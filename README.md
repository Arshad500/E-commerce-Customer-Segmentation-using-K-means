# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation-using-K-means
This repository contains a comprehensive customer segmentation and analysis project that utilizes KMeans clustering to identify distinct customer groups based on their search and order patterns. The primary goal of this project is to assist businesses in understanding their customers' behavior, enabling them to develop targeted marketing strategies and optimize their product offerings.

The project includes the following key steps:

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Yellowbrick
Data

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Importing the dataset, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
Data Exploration: Gaining insights into the dataset by analyzing the distribution of variables, visualizing the relationships between features, and identifying potential outliers.
Data Scaling: Scaling the features using MinMaxScaler to ensure that all variables are on the same scale for accurate clustering.
Optimal Cluster Selection: Using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters for KMeans clustering.
Clustering: Applying KMeans clustering to the dataset and assigning customers to their respective clusters.
Cluster Analysis: Investigating the characteristics of each cluster, including the number of customers, search patterns, and past orders.
Results
The customers have been segmented into distinct groups based on their search patterns and past orders. These insights can be used to develop targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment.

This repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about customer segmentation, KMeans clustering, and data analysis. The techniques and insights presented here can be adapted to various datasets and industries, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and research.
